                        <p>L-Egant Solutions (LES) sells high-voltage components, systems, and diagnostics; products that are focused
                            on research and development activities involving the delivery of high-electrical power, commonly referred to as
                            &ldquo;pulsed-power.&rdquo; Our high voltage components and systems offerings are imported from Zeonics Systech, of India,
                            which was founded in 1981, and manufactures products that are custom built to customer specifications.
                            Zeonics&nbsp;is a leader in high-voltage, pulsed-power components and systems and many of their products
                            perform similarly to what is available in the USA, at substantially reduced cost over comparable items
                            available domestically.

                         <p> Laboratory  R&amp;D is a highly-competitive, cost-constrained endeavor, which is typical for all disciplines of
                        science, engineering and technology. The pulsed-power speciality relies on the use of sophisticated, high-voltage equipment, for
                            charging, storing, switching, and delivering electrical energy efficiently, and often at the fastest timescales
                            possible to produce extremes in the assembled energy density. Frequently, the materials involved are
                            in a state of high-electrical ionization, that is characteristic of the field of  physics that studies plasma.</p>

                        <p>As the founding principal of LES and an active research
                            physicist/scientist, I am happy to extol my many years experience in these areas.
                            I founded this company to help address the many difficult years of  finding cost-effective laboratory equipment
                            for my own research, where it  often  seemed  that my
                            needs were typically more expensive than my available resource funding. Thus, I usually
                            resorted to building my equipment from scratch, or modifying surplus components, rather than buying it outright.
                            As  gratifying as this learning process is, it does impact goal-focused workflow and project productivity.</p>

                        <p>My research career started with a Ph.D. in physics, from the University of California, Irvine, studying
                            the direct injection of intense ion beams into a fusion reactor. After that I worked on ion-space propulsion at
                            the Hughes Research Laboratories, where I was fortunate enough to be able to extend the system performance 5X and
                            reduce the parts count 100X, and document it in a patent. HRL was close to UCLA so naturally I spent much many
                            of my evenings regularly attending their seminar series on entrepreneurship; at this time startups did not
                            have the same cache as they do today. Eventually, my HRL colleagues and I embarked on writing our own business
                            plan and succeeded at getting it funded as MicroBeam, Inc.;&nbsp;developing focused-ion beams for microelectronics
                            at $1 M/unit.&nbsp;Shortly after we opened our doors, I left the company, as our funding was contingent upon
                            &ldquo;much" more optimistic  sales forecasts than what reality could support.</p>

                        <p>I returned to UC Irvine, doing R &amp D on magnetic-field compression in a
                            Z-pinch, x-ray lithography, and the propagation of intense ion beams. Z-pinches have historically been an
                            attractive option for fusion, since they provide an easy way to produce extremes in the  compressed-plasma-energy density. Eventually,
                            I was successful at funding the "Staged Z-pinch" (SZP) Project, in a highly competitive  Department of Energy procurement
                            for alternate fusion concepts. Eventually, this research lead to a new method for energy delivery in a fusion target, with
                            many papers and two patents, and the basis for my third start-up, 15 years later, as Magneto-Inertial Fusion Technologies, Inc.
                            (MIFTI); which continues today to develop the SZP for fusion and the production of medical isotopes.</p>

                        <p>My earlier PhD work with Norman Rostoker, on intense-ion beam propagation evolved into another new concept for
                            fusion, based on a Field-Reversed Magnetic Configuration (FRC). Basically, the magnetic configuration was linear,
                            high-magnetic beta, and with the use of intense beams at MeV energies, allowed for the use of advanced fusion fuel cycles.
                            One day, while we were chatting about the lack of comomunity vision and funding for this idea, it occurred to me that we
                            should write a business plan to raise money. We eventually did that, with others, forming what was called Tri Alpha
                            Energy, Inc, my second startup. Finding an appropriate name for the company as I did, with the strong opinions of such an
                            eclectic group of co-founders, was a particular challenge!</p>

                        <p>Laboratory based R&amp;D is inherently a highly-competitive, cost-constrained endeavor; and this is typical for all disciplines of
                            science, engineering and technology. So today, I am trying something a little different, that is  less focused on developing
                            new fusion ideas, and more on providing cost-effective products,  solutions, and diagnostics; some of which are
                            compiled here on the L-Egant Solutions website. </p>

                        <p>I'm pleased to announce that LES is also offering our first, home-grown diagnostic product,
                            the -   Second-Harmonic Dispersion Interferometer (SHDI), which is available in two configurations:
                            as a 1-dimensional probe instrument and a 2-dimensional probe instrument. Having personally used
                            this diagnostic in my research, I am convinced and can attest to the fact that the performance is nothing short of
                            exceptional and I expect that it will soon be in high demand for many applications, from plasma, gas, and liquids,
                            and in particular for microscopy, where SHDI concepts are currently used and in particular, highly complex. For those
                        of you interested in developing/offering your own diagnostic products, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. </p>

                        <p>As always, it will be my great pleasure to provide you with the highest level of support for your research needs,
                            and to facilitate your discoveries efficiently, at low cost. Wishing you success in all  your research endeavours,</p>
