                        <p>L-Egant Solutions (LES) sells high-voltage components, systems, and diagnostics; products that are focussed
                            on research and development activities involving the delivery of high-electrical power, commonly referred to as
                            &ldquo;pulsed-power.&rdquo; This speciality relies on the use of sophisticated, high-voltage equipment, for
                            charging, storing, switching, and delivering electrical energy efficiently, and often at the fastest timescales
                            possible to produce extremes in the assembled energy density. Frequently, the materials involved are
                            in a state of high-electrical ionization, that is characteristic of the field of  physics that studies plasma.</p>

                        <p>As the founding principal of LES and an active research
                            physicist/scientist, I am happy to extol my many years experience in these areas.
                            I founded this company to address many years of difficulties I
                            experienced in finding cost-effective laboratory equipment for my own research. It  often  seemed  that my
                            needs were always a little more expensive than the resource funding that I had available. Thus, I usually had to
                            resort to building something from scratch, or by modifying surplus components, rather than buying it outright.
                            Of course, this is a  gratifying learning process of discovery. However, it does negatively impact your
                            goal-focused workflow and project productivity.</p>

                        <p>My career in research started with a Ph.D. in physics, from the University of California, Irvine, studying
                            methods to inject intense ion beams into a fusion reactor. After that I worked on ion-space propulsion at
                            the Hughes Research Laboratories, where I was fortunate enough to be close to UCLA and where I could regularly
                            attend their seminar series on entrepreneurship, at a time when startups did not
                            have the same appeal as they do today. While still at HRL, my colleagues and I embarked on writing our own business
                            plan and succeeded at funding MicroBeam, Inc.,&nbsp;developing focused-ion beams for microelectronics
                            at $1 M/unit.&nbsp;Shortly after opening our doors, I left the company, as it was  necessary to be
                            &ldquo;more&rdquo; optimistic about our sales than what reality could support.</p>

                        <p>I returned to UC Irvine, doing R &amp D on magnetic-field compression in a
                            Z-pinch, x-ray lithography, and intense-charged particle beam propagation. Z-pinches have historically been an
                            attractive option for fusion, since they provide an easy way to produce extremes in the  compressed-plasma-energy density. Eventually,
                            I went on to successfully fund the "Staged Z-pinch" (SZP) Project, in a highly competitive procurement for alternate fusion concepts
                            from the Department of Energy.</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, the SZP lead to a new method for energy delivery in a fusion target, with many papers and two patents that
                            eventually served as the basis for my third start-up 15 years later, Magneto-Inertial Fusion Technologies, Inc.
                            (MIFTI), which continues to develop the SZP for fusion and the production of medical isotopes.</p>

                        <p>My earlier PhD work with Norman Rostoker, on intense-beam propagation also evolved into another new concept for
                            fusion, based on a Field-Reversed Magnetic Configuration (FRC). One day, while I was chatting with Norman about the
                            lack of funding for this idea, I suggested we write a business plan and raise money, which we eventually
                            did, with others, to form my second startup, Tri Alpha Energy.</p>

                        <p>Laboratory based R&amp;D is a highly-competitive, cost-constrained endeavor, typical in all disciplines of
                            science, engineering and technology. Today, I am less focused on developing new fusion ideas, and
                            more on providing cost-effective products,  solutions, and diagnostics to researchers; some of which are
                            compiled here on the L-Egant Solutions website. Our high voltage component offerings are imported
                            from Zeonics Systech, of India, founded in 1981.
                            Zeonics&nbsp;is a leader in high-voltage, pulsed-power components and systems and many of their products
                            perform similarly to what is available in the USA, at substantially reduced cost over comparable items
                            available domestically.</p>

                        <p>LES is also offering our first, home-grown diagnostic product, the -   Second-Harmonic Dispersion
                            Interferometer (SHDI). The SHDI is available in two configurations: as a 1-dimensional probe instrument and a
                            2-dimensional probe instrument. Having used this diagnostic in my personal research, I am convinced that it will
                            soon be in high demand for many applications, from plasma, gas, and liquids, especially for microscopy. For those
                        of you interested in developing/offering your own diagnostic products, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. </p>

                        <p>As always, it will be a great pleasure to provide you with the highest level of support for your research needs,
                            and to facilitate your discoveries efficiently, at low cost.</p>
